Creating a professional blog API using vanilla PHP with all industry-level features and functionalities is a comprehensive task. However, I'll do my best to guide you through the process and provide a high-level overview of the essential components and features you'll need to implement.

Before we begin, I want to clarify that I cannot execute code or access external resources. I'll provide you with the necessary code snippets, explanations, and instructions, but you'll need to implement them yourself.

Here's a breakdown of the essential features and functionalities you should consider for a professional blog API:

User Authentication and Authorization:
- User registration and login system
- JSON Web Token (JWT) or session-based authentication
- Role-based access control (admin, author, regular user)
Blog Post Management:
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts
- Support for rich text formatting (e.g., Markdown, HTML)
- Image upload and management
- Categories and tags for posts
- Post drafts and publishing workflow
User Management (for admins):
- CRUD operations for user accounts
- Ability to assign roles and permissions
Comments and Interactions:
- CRUD operations for comments
- Comment moderation and approval system
- Like/dislike functionality for posts
Search and Filtering:
- Full-text search for blog posts
- Filtering posts by category, tag, author, date range, etc.
API Documentation:
- Provide comprehensive API documentation using a tool like Swagger or APIDocJS
Security:
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Rate limiting and throttling
Caching:
- Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
Error Handling:
- Proper error handling and logging
Pagination and Sorting:
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Sorting options for posts (e.g., by date, popularity, etc.)
Analytics and Metrics:
- Track and report user activity, post views, and other metrics
Testing:
- Write unit tests and integration tests for the API
Deployment and Maintenance:
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

This is a high-level overview of the essential features and functionalities you should consider for a professional blog API. Each of these components can be further broken down into smaller tasks and sub-features.

To implement this API, you'll need to leverage various PHP concepts and libraries, such as:

PHP web framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, or vanilla PHP)
Database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or others)
PHP Data Objects (PDO) or database abstraction layer
Authentication and authorization libraries (e.g., php-jwt, php-auth)
File upload and image processing libraries
Caching libraries (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
Logging and error handling libraries
API documentation tools (e.g., Swagger, APIDocJS)
Testing frameworks (e.g., PHPUnit, Codeception)
Deployment tools (e.g., Docker, CI/CD pipelines)
Remember, implementing a professional blog API requires a solid understanding of PHP, web development concepts, database management, security best practices, and software engineering principles. It's a complex task, but breaking it down into smaller components and tackling them one by one can make the process more manageable.
